In simple terms, when your skin is exposed to sunlight, tyrosinase kicks in and stimulates melanin production, which darkens the skin - this is what we commonly refer to as tanning. However, excessive melanin production can lead to hyperpigmentation issues, such as age spots, melasma, and uneven skin tone."
